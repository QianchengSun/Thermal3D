# Thermal3D
This is the work flow for object 3D reconstruction with thermal information.
In order to generate a 3D thermal point cloud, here are several stepes that has to have.
1. Use OpenMVG to generate a the 3D point cloud by using RGB images.
2. Use OpenMVS to densify the sparks point cloud which generated from OpenMVG.
3. Use demo.py to generate the object 3D thermal point cloud.



The work flow has been listed in demo.py
